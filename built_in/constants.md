# Built-in Constants


## \_\_debug\_\_

This constant is true if Python was not started with an [` -O `](<https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-O>) option. See also the [` assert `](<https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assert>) statement.

## Ellipsis

The same as the ellipsis literal "` ... `". Special value used mostly in conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data types. ` Ellipsis ` is the sole instance of the [` types.EllipsisType `](<https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.EllipsisType>) type.

## False

The false value of the [` bool `](<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool>) type.

> Source: [` Built-in Constants | False `](<https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#False>)


## None

An object frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a function. ` None ` is the sole instance of the [` NoneType `](<https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.NoneType>) type.

## NotImplemented

A special value which should be returned by the binary special methods to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other type; may be returned by the in-place binary special methods for the same purpose. It should not be evaluated in a boolean context. ` NotImplemented ` is the sole instance of the [` types.NotImplementedType `](<https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.NotImplementedType>) type.

> [!CAUTION]
> ` NotImplemented ` and ` NotImplementedError ` are not interchangeable. This constant should only be used as described above; see [` NotImplementedError `](<https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NotImplementedError>) for details on correct usage of the exception.


## True

The true value of the [` bool `](<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool>) type.
